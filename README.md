# my-first-R-package
My first R package!

I wrote an R function even_or_odd(number) to test whether a number is even or odd.
If the number is not an integer, the function returns the appropriate message.
If the input is not a number, the function also handles this as an "exception" by showing a message without testing.

To install this R package, please use the following command:
devtools::install_github("star1327p/my-first-R-package/myfirstpackage")
